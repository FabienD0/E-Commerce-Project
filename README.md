# E-Commerce Project

My first group project was to build a full-stack complete online store. During this project, I learned a lot about decision making,how to work with a team using Git and how to solve merge conflict.

React was used for the front end. Node.js and MongoDB for the back end.

- Quantity can be added or removed.
- Adding to cart.
- A search bar that searches every product in the database.
- 'Out of stock' products cannot be added to cart.
- Filter items by categories or brands.
- A modal will pop up in the cart displaying an icon once you add a product.
- In the cart, you have the option to remove individual items or clear the entire cart.
- The checkout page computes the total cost with taxes, which will update automatically if you change the quantity from the same page.
- The back-end system will verify that the information you provide in the checkout form is correct. If not, an error message will appear.
- After your order is confirmed, you'll see a confirmation page with your unique order ID, and all the details will be saved in the database.
